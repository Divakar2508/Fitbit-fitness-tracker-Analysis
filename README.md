# Fitbit-fitness-tracker-Analysis
An analysis of smart device fitness data that provides the necessary insight in order to unlock new growth opportunities for the company.

Objective:

Identify trends in how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices to develop insights and recommendations for Bellabeat marketing strategy.

Data Source:

The data source, FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, used for this case study comes from Kaggle.

The datasets consist of personal tracker information from thirty FitBit users across eighteen CSV files filled with quantitative metrics in long data format
and datasets that include aggregate data. For example, Daily_Activity combined tracker data found in the Daily_Steps, Calories, and Intensities datasets.

Challenges:

Unfortunately, most datasets contained missing information for users and not enough participants, such as the Weight_Log containing only 8 users' information and Daily_Sleep where only 3 participants have a complete record of data
and then I found it most useful to only examine and clean the following dataset

I used Python to upload and clean the data in a manner that is quick, efficient, and will best address the business task.
